# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the public API endpoints and user-facing pages as requested.

## 1. Public API Endpoints

Created the following route handlers under `/src/app/api/public/`:

### GET /api/public/schools
- Query params: `type?=university|language`, `q?=keyword`, `page?`, `pageSize?`
- Returns: `{ items: SchoolDTO[], total, page, pageSize }`
- Features:
  - Zod validation for query parameters
  - Caching headers (s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=300)
  - Filtering by school type
  - Search functionality
  - Pagination support
  - Error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### GET /api/public/schools/[slug]
- Returns a single school with all available information
- Features:
  - Proper error handling for 404 cases
  - Caching headers
  - Security (no internal notes or secrets returned)

### GET /api/public/brochures
- Query params: `schoolId=...` | `slug=...`
- Returns brochures for a school
- Features:
  - Retrieves brochures based on school ID or slug
  - Proper error handling
  - Caching headers

## 2. Shared Types & Mappers

### DTOs (`/src/lib/dto.ts`)
- `SchoolDTO`: Defines the structure for school data in API responses
- `BrochureDTO`: Defines the structure for brochure data in API responses

### Mappers (`/src/lib/mappers.ts`)
- `mapSchoolToDTO()`: Converts Prisma School model to SchoolDTO
- Ensures data transformation without schema changes

## 3. Data Fetching on User Pages

### Universities Page (`/src/app/universities/page.tsx`)
- Fetches from `/api/public/schools?type=university`
- Implements loading states, error handling, and skeletons
- Includes search and filtering functionality
- Responsive grid layout with UniversityCard components
- Pagination controls

### Language Institutes Page (`/src/app/language-institutes/page.tsx`)
- Fetches from `/api/public/schools?type=language`
- Implements loading states, error handling, and skeletons
- Includes search and filtering functionality
- Responsive grid layout with UniversityCard components
- Pagination controls

### School Detail Page (`/src/app/schools/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Fetches from `/api/public/schools/[slug]`
- Displays detailed school information
- Shows brochures for the school
- Responsive layout with proper styling

## 4. Error Handling

### API Client (`/src/lib/api-client.ts`)
- Robust fetchers with response.ok checks
- JSON parse error protection
- Error messages with HTTP status and snippet
- Proper typing for all API responses

### Pages
- Try/catch on all data fetching
- Friendly error UI with retry functionality
- Skeleton loading states

## 5. UI Polish

### Components
- `UniversityCard`: Reusable card component for displaying schools
- `BackToTopButton`: Floating button on all user pages
- `SchoolSearchFilter`: Search and filter component for schools
- `Pagination`: Reusable pagination component

### Features
- Card grid with logo, name, city/country, tags
- "View details" button linking to /schools/[slug]
- Search input with type filters
- Pagination controls
- "Back to Top" floating button

## 6. Performance & SEO

### Caching
- All public API endpoints use fetch with `{ next: { revalidate: 60 } }`
- Proper Cache-Control headers (s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=300)

### SEO
- Pages are server-rendered for better SEO
- Proper metadata and structured data

## 7. Tests / Acceptance Criteria

### Verification
- Creating a school in Admin makes it appear in user list after refresh (≤60s)
- Updating a school in Admin updates the public detail page (≤60s)
- Deleting a school removes it from lists and returns 404 on detail endpoint
- Brochure upload in Admin appears on the school detail page

### Test Plan
A comprehensive test plan has been created in `__tests__/api.test.ts` outlining:
- Tests for all public API endpoints
- Expected behavior for various input parameters
- Error handling scenarios
- Edge cases

## 8. Additional Features

### Reusable Components
- `UniversityCard`: Consistent display of school information
- `BackToTopButton`: Improved user experience
- `SchoolSearchFilter`: Consistent search/filter functionality
- `Pagination`: Reusable pagination component

### Type Safety
- Strong typing throughout the application
- Proper interfaces for all data structures
- Type mapping between API responses and UI components

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly components

## Security Considerations

- Public API endpoints are read-only
- No authentication required for public endpoints
- No internal notes or secrets are exposed
- Proper input validation with Zod
- Error messages don't expose internal details

## Performance Optimizations

- Caching with revalidation
- Skeleton loading states
- Efficient data fetching
- Code splitting
- Image optimization
